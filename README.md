# AED Simulation Interface Project

## Overview

This project is a simulation of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) interface designed to train individuals in the proper use of an AED during emergency situations. The simulation provides an interactive environment where users can practice the steps necessary to assist someone experiencing sudden cardiac arrest.

## Interface Demonstration

The interface is divided into two main sections: the First Aider Point of View and the AED Interface.

### First Aider Point of View

- Conscious Check
- Breath Check
- Pad Placement
- Heart Rhythm Detected
- First-aider in contact
- Compression Correction

### AED Interface

- Check Consciousness
- Call Emergency
- Open Airway
- Check Breath
- Pad Placement
- Heart Analysis
- Shock
- CPR

## Features

- **Conscious Check:** Verify if the patient is conscious.
- **Breath Check:** Check if the patient is breathing normally.
- **Pad Placement:** Select the correct pad placement on the patient's chest.
- **Heart Rhythm Detection:** The AED will analyze the patient's heart rhythm. Options include normal rhythm, fibrillation, etc.
- **CPR Feedback:** Provides feedback on the quality of chest compressions and rescue breaths.
- **Battery Indicator:** Alerts the user when the AED battery is below optimal levels.

## How to Use

1. Start by checking the consciousness and breath of the patient using the checkboxes.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to call emergency services and open the patient's airway.
3. Place the AED pads as indicated and allow the device to analyze the heart rhythm.
4. If the device advises, deliver a shock by pressing the 'Shock' button.
5. After delivering the shock, perform CPR as guided by the interface, focusing on the quality of chest compressions and rescue breaths.
6. Monitor the AED battery level to ensure the device remains operational.

## Installation

To set up the simulation interface:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (QT Creator).
3. Run the application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/aed-simulation.git
